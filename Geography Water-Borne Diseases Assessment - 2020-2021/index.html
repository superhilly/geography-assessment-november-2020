  <h2>What are water-borne diseases?</h2>
  <p>Waterborne diseases are caused by a variety of microorganisms, biotoxins, and toxic contaminants, which lead to fatal illnesses such as cholera and typhoid. Outbreaks of waterborne diseases often happen after an extreme precipitation event (e.g
    rainfall and snowfall).</p>
  <p>While diarrhea and vomiting are the most commonly reported symptoms of waterborne illness, other symptoms can include skin, ear, respiratory, or eye problems. The term waterborne disease is reserved largely for infections that predominantly are transmitted through contact with or consumption of infected water. Trivially, many infections may be transmitted by microbes or parasites that accidentally, possibly as a result of exceptional circumstances, have entered the water, but the fact that there might be an occasional freak infection need not mean that it is useful to categorise the resulting disease is "waterborne".</p>
  <h2>How do water-borne diseases spread?</h2>
  <p>Waterborne diseases can spread by having pathogenic microorganisms living and being transmitted in water. Bathing, washing, drinking water are all ways of spreading waterborne diseases.</p>
  <h2>Why are water-borne diseases dangerous?</h2>
  <p>Climate change increases the severity and frequency of some major precipitation events, communities—especially in the developing world—could be faced with an elevated disease burden from waterborne diseases. In addition, diseases caused by
    Vibrio bacteria such as cholera and other intestinal diseases may pose a greater threat due to the effect that rising sea temperatures will have on the growth and spread of bacteria.</p>
  <p>The result: dangerous diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. Other waterborne diseases include diarrhoea, dysentery, polio and meningitis. Unclean water for washing can cause skin and infectious eye disease such as Trachoma. Trachoma can lead
    to visual impairment or blindness.</p>

  <h2>Where are people likely to get water-borne diseases?</h2>
  <p>Waterborne diseases are most likely to be found in rural villages or countries, especially ones that don’t have much access to clean water. Countries like Yemen, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan have a large percentage of people who have little to no access to clean water.</p>
  <p>Other reasons can come into play such as droughts or weather events. Looking at the map, Africa has the most deaths in the map with most of the countries being dark blue. A part of East-asia also has a considerable amount of deaths as well.</p>

  <h2>Importance of handwashing</h2>
  <p>Hand washing can prevent germs and infections, as people frequently touch their eyes, nose and mouth. The germs can go into our body and make us ill, touching objects that are out in public has many germs since many people have touched it,
    especially objects which are commonly used (such as door handles and handrails). Possible diseases caused by poor hygiene (not handwashing) include influenza, chicken pox, etc.</p>
  <h2>History of Handwashing</h2>
  <p>Surgeons began regularly scrubbing up in the 1870s, but the importance of everyday handwashing did not become universal until more than a century later. It wasn't until the 1980s that hand hygiene was officially incorporated into American health
    care with the first national hand hygiene guidelines.</p>
  <p>Ignac Semmelweis—Father of Hand Hygiene</p>
  <p>The young Dr. Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from puerperal fever — commonly known as childbed fever. He studied two maternity wards in the hospital. One was staffed by all male doctors and
    medical students, and the other was staffed by female midwives.</p>
  <h2>Benefits of Handwashing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Less risk of getting sick</li>
    <li>Prevent dangerous diseases and infections</li>
    <li>Reduce the spread of bacteria</li>
    <li>Lower chance of spreading germs to others</li>
    <li>Maintain skin moisture</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Facts about handwashing and germs on your hands</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Germs can survive for up to three hours on your hands.</li>
    <li>There are between 2 to 10 million bacteria on your fingertips and elbows.</li>
    <li>The number of germs on your fingertips doubles after you use the toilet.</li>
    <li>When you don’t wash your hands, you transfer germs to the food and drinks you eat.</li>
    <li>Your hands spread 1,000 times more germs when they are damp than when they are dry.</li>
    <li>Only about 5% of people wash their hands correctly.</li>
    <li>Most people only wash their hands for 6 seconds.</li>
    <li>Around 33% of people don’t use soap when washing their hands.</li>
    <li>Up to 80% of communicable diseases are transferred by touch.</li>
    <li>Dirty sinks result in less handwashing.</li>
    <li>There is fecal matter on 10% of credit cards, 14% of banknotes and 16% of cellphones.</li>
    <li>Approximately 39% of people don’t wash their hands after sneezing, coughing or after blowing their nose.</li>
    <li>Elevator buttons harbor 22% more bacteria than toilet seats.</li>
    <li>Reminder signs are successful in encouraging more handwashing.</li>
    <li>Handwashing rates are higher in the mornings than evenings.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to handwash</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Wet your hands</li>
    <li>Squirt foam or soap into your hands</li>

  <h2>What is a water basin?</h2>
  <p>A water basin, also known as a sink is a bowl-shaped tool mainly used for hand-washing. It is typically placed in a toilet or bathroom. The sink features a faucet and drain. The faucet provides hot and cold water. The drain takes away all the used and unwanted water. It is important to have a water basin because it is a station for hand washing, which is important for good hygiene.</p>

  <h2>How to use a water basin</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Push up the faucet lever to turn on the faucet. The higher you turn it up the stronger the water will come out of the tap. If you turn the lever to the left it will be hot water, to the right is cold water.</li>
    <li>Wash your hands.</li>
    <li>To turn off the faucet, push the lever down towards the sink. There is no need to twist the lever left and right.</li>
